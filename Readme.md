# Interview_Questions

## This project is intended to help students and job seekers prepare to crack coding interviews.

**Any helpful material** is welcome, primarily focusing on various types of _interview questions_, and _tips and tricks_. 

The long term goal is to create an open source website with these resources. 

This repo is pretty open, welcoming new suggestions and contributions while learning at the same time.
