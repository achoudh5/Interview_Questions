## Role

- **Role:** Full Stack Engineer
- **Team Size:** 1-10 people
- **Location:** New Zealand

### What We Look For

* Team fit is key for small teams and startups. Be your likable self – do not pretend to be someone else.
* For recent graduates, we look for genuine curiosity and ability to adapt and learn.
* Engineering mindset
* How well you understand the trade-offs between engineering time and business value.
* The ability to articulate technical ideas, concepts or solutions, discuss technical details of software and its design
* You can give direct answers to a question. Funnily, some candidates go on and on about something tangential but never really give direct answers – despite being asked similar questions multiple times.
